A feeling of control
is what I really need
Instead you take my soul
No dignity for me

You make me dance to music
With no rhythm or no beat
You build me up with praise
To knock me off my feet

Your puppet on a string
fulfilling your hearts desire
that's all I'll ever be
hanging from this wire

Like Pinocchio and his dreams
of becoming a little boy
I need to be more in life
than someone's little toy."

To look upon this island
from far above the trees
you think you've found the perfect place
for heaven on earth to be

You move in a little closer
to walk along its beach
to feel the sand between your toes
it's all within your reach

You decide to make this island
a place you now call home
it's everything you ever wanted
a shelter from the storm

But the storm is never over
on this little island in the sea
the very things that drew you near
are the reasons why you leave

The branches of the trees
stretching outward for a hand
never reaching far enough
to escape this little land

The water on the beaches
where you loved to swim and play
kept the island to itself
as it slowly washed away."
